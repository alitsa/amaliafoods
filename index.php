<h1>Amalia Foods LLC</h1>
<p>
  Amalia Foods LLC is a food manufacturer and distributor based in Austin, TX.

<p>
  Hi! This is Amalia Litsa, the principal product developer and owner of Amalia Foods LLC.
</p>
<p>
  My mission is to develop affordable vegan food and beverage options for small business owners like myself.
</p>
<p>
  My flagship product is <a target="_blank" href="https://briccoblends.com">Bricco Blends</a>, a barista grade oat milk powder that launches in the summer of 2022.
</p>
<p>
  I originally developed Bricco Blends for my own coffee shop, <a target="_blank" href="https://deardiary.coffee">Dear Diary Coffee</a>. It whitens coffee beautifully and makes lovely latte foam.
</p>
<p>
  I'm currently working on <strong>Hunny Bunny</strong>, a vegan honey alternative for coffee shops and restaurants. Right now we're just piloting it at Dear Diary. Stop on by and try it in a latte!
